// Example:
//
// const Puppy = require('./puppy')
// const Owner = require('./owner')

// After you've required all of your models into this module, you should establish
// associations (https://sequelize-guides.netlify.com/association-types/) between them here as well!
// Example:
//
// Puppy.belongsTo(Owner)
